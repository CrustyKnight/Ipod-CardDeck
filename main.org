* TODOS
** TODO: Icons
** TODO: Better menu (clear the screen after an option has been selected)
** TODO: Default screen (Maybe like showing the top card of discard, how many cards left in deck, and how many cards in discard)
Like show two decks, the top of the discard and the top of the deck. maybe an
image of like a card back for the back of the deck?  also maybe a counter for
how many cards left in pile.
** TODO: Save and load a deck
*** TODO: Make an easily readable and writable format
Probably just something like
#+BEGIN_SRC
H, 13
H, 12
H, 11
H, 10
H, 9
H, 8
#+END_SRC
Then I use text parsing to get each line, split it into suite and number, then add that to a table
