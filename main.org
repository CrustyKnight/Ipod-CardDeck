* TODOS
** TODO: Icons
** TODO: Better menu (clear the screen after an option has been selected)
** TODO: Default screen (Maybe like showing the top card of discard, how many cards left in deck, and how many cards in discard)
** TODO: Save and load a deck
*** TODO: Make an easily readable and writable format
Probably just something like
#+BEGIN_SRC
H, 13
H, 12
H, 11
H, 10
H, 9
H, 8
#+END_SRC
Then I use text parsing to get each line, split it into suite and number, then add that to a table
